# projectileMotionComputerProgram
 In this project, a projectile motion computer program is built using Python 3. The program requires 3 inputs and it finds the other points of the parabola with a close approximation using the background calculations. For drawing a parabola, 3 points are needed. Thatâ€™s why, the program asks the user to enter the initial height of the object, the maximum height of the object, and the range. With the input values and the calculated points, the program draws the projectile motion graph of an object and using the kinematic formulas, it finds the unknown parameters.
